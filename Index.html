        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my page! My journey with Chili's began over five years ago, when I first joined the team as a manager. With hard work, dedication, and a passion for creating an exceptional dining experience, I was quickly promoted to General Manager. My commitment to excellence and leadership didn't go unnoticed, and within five years, I achieved the role of Managing Partner at Chili's in Auburn Hills.</p>
        
        <p>I’m incredibly proud to lead this fantastic restaurant, but I couldn’t do it without the support of my outstanding management team. Tiffany, Ted, and T Wright are the best managers in the world, bringing their expertise, energy, and enthusiasm to our daily operations. Together, we work tirelessly to ensure that every guest leaves our restaurant with a smile and a memorable experience.</p>
